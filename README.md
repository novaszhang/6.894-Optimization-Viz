# Visualizing Interative Gradient Descent

Dao Ming and Nova Zhang

### Contributions

For this project, we worked closely on all parts of the project. More specifically:

Nova worked on the general layout, adding learning rate customization, adjusting the custom function descent, and adding finishing details. Nova was very focused on the aethetic of the application. She added many of the details on the layout, such as the various toggles,and created the sidebar. A large portion of her effort was towards figuring out how to create the descent visualizations for custom functions. More specifically, Nova experimented with the customizability of descent methods and getting the descent to map for custom functions. Since with custom functions it is not certain that descent methods will converge within a reasonable time, Nova experimented with different metrics to limit the number of iterations descent methods eventually take. Nova also worked on the write-ups for this project.

Dao Ming worked on adding iteration features, adding details to interface, creating the custom functions feature space, and writing the paper. He added the iteration counters and bar graph. He also added finishing details to the interface, such as the title and tooltips over the different descent methods. Dao Ming also spent a large portion of his time creating the custom functions features space. This was a challenge because it served the basis of our custom function visualization and figuring out how to graph the custom function was integral to the page's success. He also helped immensely in making the custom function descent work and map onto the heatmap. Dao Ming also worked on the meat of the paper.

While these are parts we individually focused on, both of us had a hand in almost every part of the visualization and deliverables for this project.
